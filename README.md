# Bounties Component Library

This represents the core components we used to build our [explorer](https://explorer.bounties.network) found in this [repo](https://github.com/Bounties-Network/explorer).

Our documentation and interactive live demo of the components [lives in storybook](https://components.bounties.network).

This library is currently in alpha, and we are finalizing the pieces (build, structure, etc.) in order to make it a public, open source, configurable library.

This work will be done very soon, and we're excited to welcome the community to contribute. :)
